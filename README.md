# Cyber-Threat-Management
### Information Security Block
Cyber-Threat Management is a framework that often used to manage the life cycle of a threat, helping me identify and respond to it with speed and accuracy. At its core, threat management relies on the seamless integration of people, processes, and technology to stay ahead of emerging threats (Pathak P, 2020). The process is continuous and involves several key stages: assessment, mitigation, insurance, detection, and remediation.

In applying the threat management cycle, I focused on various domains such as System Security, Security Policy, Organizational Security, Asset Classification and Control, Personnel Security, Physical and Environmental Security, Communications and Operations Management, Access Control, Systems Development and Maintenance, Business Continuity Management, Compliance, or Financial Considerations. My discussions on threat management were always informed by specific threats or vulnerabilities within the Security Development Lifecycle, organization, or system.

To enhance threat management further, I designed my own Threat Model based on my understanding of the threat management cycle. I created attack trees to visually represent potential threat scenarios. For example, I developed an attack tree for "Unauthorized Access to a System" or "A Fraud Attack Tree." This approach allowed me to break down threats into more manageable components, assess risks, and develop strategies for mitigating those threats effectively.

#### Data Breach Attack Tree

I designed a Data Breach Attack Tree to illustrate various threat vectors leading to data breaches. The tree categorizes attacks into four main types: **External**, **Internal**, **Physical**, and **Social Engineering**. External attacks include phishing and exploiting software vulnerabilities, while internal attacks involve malicious insiders and accidental data exposure. Physical attacks focus on device theft or unauthorized facility access. Social engineering threats include tactics like scareware and pretexting. This model helps in visualizing the different ways data breaches can occur and the associated vulnerabilities to address.
